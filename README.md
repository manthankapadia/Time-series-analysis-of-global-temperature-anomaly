# time-series-analysis-of-global-temperature-anomaly
The aim of this project is to perform time series analysis on the global temperature evolution. Time series analysis and forecasting has become a major tool in numerous applications in meteorology and other environmental areas to understand phenomena, like rainfall, humidity, temperature, draught etc. Time series is one of the interesting topics in data analytics, we are motivated towards exploring this method of analysis where we are also able to perform future predictions. The approach is to work on the data based on land-ocean and land-air data which involves analyzing both the areas and coming up with the best model which can predict overall temperature.
